## What is Film Finder?

[Film Finder](https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Film-Finder) is a movie discovery app that helps you find your next favorite film by recommending random movies based on your chosen genre.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to practice working with HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to build an interactive app.

## Key Features

- **Genre Selection**: Choose from a variety of movie genres to get tailored recommendations.
- **Random Movie Suggestions**: Get a random movie suggestion based on the selected genre.
- **Like/Dislike Functionality**: Like a movie to save it or dislike it to get another recommendation.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Utilizes asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch movie data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## How to Run it
1. Clone the repository: <br>
  git clone https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Film-Finder.git <br>
2. In script.js, ...

## How to Run the Tests (bash)
1. Clone the repository: <br>
  git clone https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Film-Finder.git <br>
  cd Film-Finder
2. Run the tests: <br>
  npm test

## How It Works

1. Select a movie genre from the available options.
2. The app fetches a random movie within the chosen genre.
3. You can either like the movie to save it to your list or dislike it to receive another suggestion.

## What stage of development am I in right now?

[Film Finder](https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Film-Finder) is live and should have all planned and discussed functionalities deployed.
